## üóÇÔ∏è Database Setup

**Create and use the database:**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sql_project_p1;
USE sql_project_p1;
```

**Create the main table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(15),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(15),
    quantiy INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

## üßπ Data Cleaning

**Check for null or missing values:**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL  
   OR sale_date IS NULL 
   OR sale_time IS NULL 
   OR customer_id IS NULL 
   OR gender IS NULL 
   OR age IS NULL 
   OR category IS NULL 
   OR quantiy IS NULL  
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL 
   OR cogs IS NULL 
   OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

**Delete records with missing values:**

```sql
DELETE FROM retail_sales 
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL  
   OR sale_date IS NULL 
   OR sale_time IS NULL 
   OR customer_id IS NULL 
   OR gender IS NULL 
   OR age IS NULL 
   OR category IS NULL 
   OR quantiy IS NULL  
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL 
   OR cogs IS NULL 
   OR total_sale IS NULL;
```
